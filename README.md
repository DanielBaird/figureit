workit
======

workit.js – a library for making your scientific formulae and other data accessible to the world.  They set some inputs, and your carefully
calculated conclusions are figured out, right in their browser window.

But.. what is it?
-----------------

Here's an example.

A scientist once spent a lot of time studying the parasites that infect the fish raised in barramundi farms.  He found that if you knew the water temperature and salinity, you could work out the time eggs took to hatch, the time it took a parasite attached to a fish, and the time it took that parasite to lay its own eggs.

If you know those things, you can treat for parasites on the right days to get rid of them.  So this scientist devised a set of formulae so that if you knew the temperature and salinity, you could work out all that important information.

I wrote workit to do all the working out, so barra farmers can just type in their temperature and salinity, and get a plain english recommendation about when they should treat their barramundi.

How do I use it?
----------------

For now just look at the barramundi example, try it out, and email me if you need help making it work.
